% LoKI-GM comprises two modules, that can run self-consistently coupled 
% or as standalone tools.
% 
% LoKI-B, which solves the space independent form of the two-term 
% electron Boltzmann equation (EBE) to calculate the isotropic and the 
% anisotropic parts of the electron distribution function, 
% and the associated electron macroscopic parameters. 
% LoKI-B applies to non-magnetised non-equilibrium LTPs, excited by 
% DC/HF electric fields or time-dependent (non-oscillatory) electric fields 
% from different gases or gas mixtures. 
% The tool uses a stationary description for DC fields, 
% a Fourier time-expansion description for HF fields, 
% and a time-dependent description for time-varying fields.
% 
% LoKI-C, which solves the system of zero-dimensional (volume average) 
% rate balance equations for the most relevant 
% charged and neutral species in the plasma. 
% LoKI-C receives as input data the kinetic schemes for the gas/plasma/
% surface system under study, via an intuitive csv-like input file, 
% and gives as output the particle densities of the different gas/plasma/
% surface species, the corresponding creation/destruction reaction rates, 
% and the reduced electric field (and any related quantity, such as 
% the discharge current or the discharge power-density).
% The tool uses several modules to describe the mechanisms 
% (collisional, radiative and transport) controlling the
% creation/destruction of species, namely various transport models 
% for the charged particles and for the neutral particles. 
% LoKI-C includes also a gas/plasma thermal model, for the self-consistent 
% calculation of the gas temperature, and supports multicomponent 
% mean-field microkinetic mesoscopic models to handle surface kinetics 
% in a fully coupled way with volume kinetics.
